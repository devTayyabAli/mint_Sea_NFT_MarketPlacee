                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 fw-bold">Where to buy NFTs</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">NFTs can be purchased in two ways: on separate project websites or on NFT marketplaces.</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">Projects will occasionally create their own websites to sell their NFTs. This is often for a project's "mint" (the very first sale, when the NFT is written to the blockchain), while some projects, such as Coachella and Larva Labs, have their own autonomous marketplaces. When you purchase from a project website, you may usually resell your NFT on other NFT marketplaces</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">NFT markets will occasionally support primary sales or mints, although they are primarily responsible for secondary sales. Marketplaces differ in terms of the blockchains they support, their fee structure, the types of NFTs they specialize in, and other factors</p>

                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 fw-bold">Twitter</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">Twitter is an excellent location to learn about new NFT projects because it hosts a lot of the debate about them. You can follow accounts, hashtags, and subjects that interest you. It's a terrific way to see not only what's now hot, but also what initiatives are coming up shortly.</p>

                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 fw-bold">Marketplaces</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">NFT marketplaces are yet another excellent source of NFTs. You can examine "Trending cards" search by category, and more on Mint-Sea.</p>

                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">Let's go over how to buy an NFT:</p>

                                        <p className="text-md mb-2"><b>1.</b> Link your cryptocurrency wallet</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 ms-4">If you haven't already connected and configured your cryptocurrency wallet, you will be requested to do so during this stage.</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-2"><b>2.</b> Select a payment method</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 ms-4">Following that, you'll be asked whether you want to pay with cryptocurrency. If you wish to buy with cryptocurrency, you must first load your wallet with cryptocurrency.</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-2"><b>3.</b> Review fees </p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 ms-4">You may see that your total exceeds the advertised price for that NFT. This is due to network ("gas") expenses and, processing fees. The petrol cost is applied to all blockchain transactions, and the amount varies depending on a number of criteria, including how many users are currently using the network. These fees are not received by Mint-Sea.</p>


                                        <p className="text-md mb-2"><b>4.</b> Your purchase is now complete!</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 ms-4">Your NFT purchase is completely complete and has been written to the blockchain once you've completed all of the required information and selected "Pay." Congratulations on your purchase of an NFT!</p>

                                        <p className="text-md mb-2"><b>5.</b> Examine your most recent NFT</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 ms-4">Your brand-new NFT should be visible in your collection after a few seconds. Your new NFT will be visible in your Mint-Sea profile!</p>

                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">Yes! You can list an NFT you own for sale. </p>

                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 fw-bold">Why should I buy NFTs?</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">There are many reasons to buy an NFT that all depend on what the NFT is. You may like the art, want to support the creator, gain access to exclusive content or events, or find a community you identify with. </p>

                                        <p className="text-md mb-3 fw-bold">How can I know if an NFT is authentic?</p>
                                        <p className="text-md mb-3">Like any purchase, you want to make sure what you’re buying is authentic.Mint-Sea or a verified user created the project.

Non-fungible items are those that are unique and cannot be interchanged with another of the same type, such as an original work of art or clothing. They must be recorded on the blockchain, which is a transparent, unchangeable, and permanent online ledger that records transactions. This distinguishes an NFT from other NFTs by being both non-fungible and stored on the blockchain.</p> */}

                                        {/* <p className="text-md mb-3">Very likely, yes! Because NFTs are immutable (which means they’re unable to be changed) and offer sole ownership of an item, they’re a natural fit for purchases that need to be trackable like cars. For example, right now when buying a car, the owner received a paper title. In the future, we can see that being replaced by a smart contract on the blockchain. With a public record of ownership accessible to anyone, the owner can easily and clearly prove ownership of their car, transact with agencies like the DMV, and even sell their car later on.</p> */}

The rarity of an NFT can raise its value in larger collections. NFTs with unique characteristics tend to be more valuable than their more common counterparts.
